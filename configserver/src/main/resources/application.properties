#Config server - Contains the Java Spring Boot application for the Config Server itself. Its job: Read configs from somewhere
# (Git, filesystem, Vault, etc.) and serve them to other microservices via HTTP. Has its own application.properties to configure.
# This repo is like the ?delivery guy.?
#
#application-config repo
#Contains only configuration files, no code.This repo is the ?warehouse? where configs live.You update configs here,
# commit, push ? Config Server delivers the new version to microservices.
#
#Config Server repo = The waiter.
#application-config repo = The kitchen.
#Your microservices = The customers.
